# chapar_task

This is a Flutter task done for ["Chapar"](https://chaparnet.com) company.

## In this project, I tried to:
- Assume the task is a part of a larger project and write scalable, maintainable and clean code.
- Use best practices and packages available to do each task
- Create a minimalist design while focusing on simplicity and visual appeal
- Implementing additional features and enhancements.
  
## Additional features:
- Implemented a complete, functional delivery page (calling and navigation options available)
- Used enums, abstracttions and other dart features to maintain a clean and readable codebase
- Handled more errors than it was requested in the task description, I used regex for email field validation and implemented all error handling scenarios for server.
- I wrote unit tests to ensure my email validation function's reliability
- I used themes, constant files and shared services to prevent repetition
- I created custom classes and params to make the app more scalable
- I created splash screen and set app icon for android and ios platforms
- ...
